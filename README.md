This repository is for projects done on Codecademy<br>

Here is my Cheatsheet challenge project with HTML and CSS only.<br>
I got new ideas for that project and I'm planning on updating this repository in the future and create another one with a proper name.<br>

The goal of this project was to build our own reference cheat sheet to help us build more websites in the future!<br>
I chose to document the HTML "form" element because out of all HTML elements, it is probably one the most interesting to build and design.<br>

The project's example<br>

And mine<br>

Don't hesitate if you have some advices, tips and tricks to share with me or to improve coding<br>
I'm new in this field and eager to learn<br><br>
