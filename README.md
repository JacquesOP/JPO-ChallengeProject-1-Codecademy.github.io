This repository is for projects done on Codecademy

Here is my Cheatsheet challenge project with HTML and CSS only.
I got new ideas for that project and I'm planning on updating this repository in the future and create another one with a proper name.

The goal of this project was to build our own reference cheat sheet to help us build more websites in the future!
I chose to document the HTML <form> element because out of all HTML elements, it is probably one the most interesting to build and design.

The project's example

I'm new in this field and eager to learn
